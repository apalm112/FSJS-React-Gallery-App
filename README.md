# Gallery_App_with_React

### Build your app components according to the provided mockup. Most components should be stateless functional components that focus on the UI rather than behavior. You’ll need:

			* A container component that takes in a keyword and api key as props, and fetches the photos and other required information from the API  ✔️

			* A navigation menu component  ✔️

			* A component for each category you wish to display. For example, a Sunset component, a Flowers component, and a Clouds component.  ✔️
	* Build a static version, then can find sections of app that need to repeat or need to be conditionally shown & break them into separate components.    ✔️




* Update the CSS to resemble the mockup.		✔️

* Install React Router & set up the app components.

* Get a Flickr API key  ✔️

* Fetch the data from Flickr API  ✔️

* Display the data		
	* Use a React component lifecycle method to fetch data when the routes change. For example, if a user clicks the 'Cats' navigation link, the app will fetch and display cat images from Flickr.

	* Use a React component lifecycle method to fetch data immediately when the app loads. For example, if the root '/' path is 'Hiking', the app should display hiking images when it loads in the browser.  ✔️

* Add search field feature	✔️

* Push Goals		
		* Add a loading indicator that displays each time the app fetches new data.  
		* Include a 404-like error route that displays when a URL path does not match a route.  
	✔️	* If no matches are found by the search, include a message to tell the user there are no matches.
